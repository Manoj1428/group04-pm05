# Project Scope Management


##	To prepare a detailed project management scope statement
- Using the feedback from the employee and user, an analysis will be conducted on software applications used by the company.
- From this information, the project requirements documentation, management plan, and a traceability matrix are developed which need to be accomplished by the software applications. 
- Expert judgement is considered at all stages of the development process which helps developers to find effective ways to meet the original requirements.
	
## To create a WBS
-	To provide an effective management, the project is divided into six phases: initiation, planning, design, development, testing and deployment.  
-	Now, the work needs to be divided into sub tasks where each individual would work not more than 40 hours per week.

## To maintain and approve WBS
-	Maintenance and approval of WBS will be done by project manager based on deadline and scope of project.
-	And also, if there are any change proposed to the WBS, manager will recheck whether the new system packages are within the scope or not and accordingly approve it.

## To obtain the formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
-	Upon producing a deliverable, the team will check if deliverable meet the requirements.
-	Then it is forwarded to the project manager who will recheck the deliverables by taking the consideration of acceptance criteria defined in the requirements document and project scope statement.
- Project sponsor will notified upon completion of project.

## To control requests for changes to the project scope

## Project Quality Management
### Measuring quality
- In our Project, We carry out the Test coverage by exercising the static review techniques like peer reviews, inspections, and walkthrough.
- We will use the unit testing to validate  each unit in our software performs as designed and to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements we make use of System testing.


### Quality Management Plan:-
The goals for quality management our  project are to assure: 
- Project deliverables  should meet our stated requirements.
- Project management processes are appropriately followed.
Quality management is performed all through the project lifecycle with respect to :


|   |Description|
|--------------|----------------|
|Quality Planning |Primarily during our project planning process|
|Quality Assurance  |Primarily during our project execution process|
|Quality Control  |Primarily during our project monitoring and controlling process|
|Independent Verification & Validation |  ideally performed in all our project processes except initiation|




The quality management plan identifies these key components:

|Objects of quality review	|Quality Measure| 	Quality Evaluation Methods|
|----------|---|-----|
|Project Deliverables	| 1.Deliverable Quality Standards 2.Customer Satisfaction|	Quality Control Activities|
|Project Processes	| 1.Process Quality Standards 2.Stakeholder Expectations|	Quality Assurance Activities|

## Quality Assurance 

Quality assurance ensures that project processes are used effectively to produce quality project deliverables. It involves following and meeting standards, continuously improving project work, and correcting project defects.

The following table identifies:
- The project processes subject to quality assurance.
- The quality standards and stakeholder expectations for that process.
- The quality assurance activity – e.g., quality audit or reviews, code review - that will be executed to monitor that project processes are properly followed. 

|Project Process| Stakeholder Expectations	|Quality Assurance Activity	|Interval	|Who is Responsible|
|---------|----|---------|------|-----|
|Example: Reviewing software development exercies of software application A|	1.Software requirements specification 2.Developers have accurately captured application requirements|	Peer review of software requirements specification|	At regular intervals during the collection of requirements and a final review at the conclusion of requirements collection|	Lead developers in accordance with other knowledgeable developers|
||||||
## Quality Control
The focus of quality control is on the deliverables of the project. Quality control monitors project deliverables to verify that the deliverables are of acceptable quality and the customer is satisfied.

- The major deliverables of the project that will be tested for acceptable quality level. 
- The quality standards and customer satisfaction criteria established for the project deliverable. Included are any organizational standards that need to be followed.
- The quality control activities that will be executed to monitor the quality of the deliverables.
- How often or when the quality control activity will be performed.
- The name of the person responsible for carrying out and reporting on the quality control activity.

|Project Deliverable|	Deliverable Quality Standards/Customer Satisfaction	| Quality Control Activity|Interval|Who is Responsible|
|------|-----------|---|-----|----|
|Example:
Software application A  performs some desirable function B|	A must be free from defects.End user does not experience errors or crashes and is alright with B|	Non-developer testing of A|As released for testing by developer and before A moves between alpha, beta, and production releases	| functional representative|








## Project Resource Management

|LOW LEVEL|Developer| Testing | Senior Engineer | Interns|

An organizational chart is considered ideal manner for mapping the organization. An Organizational Chart is a tool for identifying personnel and managing the workforce effectively. An organization needs to visualize the company structure in order to understand the role each employee plays in the human resource chain.
