##	To prepare a detailed project management scope statement
-	Using the feedback from the employee and user, an analysis will be conducted on software applications used by the company.
-	From this information, the project requirements documentation, management plan, and a traceability matrix are developed which need to be accomplished by the software applications. 
-	Expert judgement is considered at all stages of the development process which helps developers to find effective ways to meet the original requirements.
	
## To create a WBS
-	To provide an effective management, the project is divided into six phases: initiation, planning, design, development, testing and deployment.  
-	Now, the work needs to be divided into sub tasks where each individual would work not more than 40 hours per week.

## To maintain and approve WBS
-	Maintenance and approval of WBS will be done by project manager based on deadline and scope of project.
-	And also, if there are any change proposed to the WBS, manager will recheck whether the new system packages are within the scope or not and accordingly approve it.

## To obtain the formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
-	Upon producing a deliverable, the team will check if deliverable meet the requirements.
-	Then it is forwarded to the project manager who will recheck the deliverables by taking the consideration of acceptance criteria defined in the requirements document and project scope statement.
- Project sponsor will notified upon completion of project.

## To control requests for changes to the project scope
-	Any project team member or sponsor can request change in project scope. Change requests are submitted to project director by project request document.
-	The project director then reviews document and then either accepts or rejects.
-	If the change request receives initial approval by the project director and sponsor, the project director will then formally submit the change request to the change control board (CCB) which either approves the change by signing document or denies it.
-	Upon acceptance of the scope change by the CCB and project sponsor the project director will update all project documents and communicate the scope change to all project team memberâ€™s stakeholders.
